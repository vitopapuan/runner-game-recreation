# runner-game-recreation
This demo project is a part of my learning process in Game Development.<br>
It is based on the tutorial about the introduction of Pygames by [Clear Code](https://youtu.be/AY9MnQ4x3zk).<br>
The assets used in this demo project were made by [Kenney](https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-pixel-edition)<br>
